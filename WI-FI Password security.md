### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
very first wireless security protocol. Later found a lot of vulnerability and also found 40 bit encryption key is not enough secure. and it's easily hackable.
### WPA (wi-fi protected access)
Stronger encryption. Uses TKiP(Temporary key integrity protocol). but later TKIP also find lots of vulneribility.
