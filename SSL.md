## What is “Encryption”?

**Encryption** = hiding data so that only authorized people can read it.

Example:  
You send “HELLO” → encryption turns it into something unreadable like `A73#@L90`.  
Only someone with the **key** can unlock and see the real message.

## 🧩 There are 2 main types of Encryption:

### **1️⃣ Symmetric Encryption**

👉 **Same key** is used to **encrypt** and **decrypt** data.

### **2️⃣ Asymmetric Encryption**

👉 **Different keys** are used — one to **encrypt**, and another to **decrypt**.

# 🔒 1. Symmetric Encryption (Same Key)

### 💡 Meaning:

Both sender and receiver use the **same secret key**.

📦 Example:

- You lock a box with a key 🔑.
    
- You send the box to your friend.
    
- Your friend **must have the same key** to open it.
    

### 🧮 Example in Computers:

You and your friend both know a secret key `abc123`.  
You type:

Plain text: HELLO
Encrypted with key 'abc123' → 9FD83A@$
